# Deep-Learning-Assignment-3
Assignment 3 of course ELL888, Deep Learning taken by Prof. Prathosh AP.

GANs are deep neural net architectures used for generating samples from a very complex distribution, such as that of natural images. In this assignment our task was to train a GAN on three real world dataset, MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR10 to generate the samples, then train a classifier on these datasets. After trainig the GAN and classifier, we had to break this classifier by training an adversarial net. 

The image generated from my GAN training on MNIST after 200 epochs is shown here :
